# intruder-detection-system-model
a model of how an intruder detection system would work. It would take in inputs such as type speed in order to differentiate users

this specific use types slow, so in the program, if you type fast, it will close the text field. This models how the actual proposed project would have worked if implemented.
This was made as a prototype for a project I did for FSE 150: Grand Challenge Scholars
